# Storybook Addon Panel Convention

## Purpose

Establish a consistent convention for Storybook stories regarding the visibility of the addon panel (Controls, Actions, Interactions, etc.) based on the Atomic Design level of the component.

---

## Rule

- **Pages & Templates:**

  - Stories for components classified as **pages** or **templates** must be presented with a clean, white canvas and **should not display the Storybook addon panel** (Controls, Actions, Interactions, etc.).
  - These stories should focus on layout, composition, and integration, not on prop manipulation.
  - If possible, configure the story to hide the addon panel using Storybook parameters:
    ```ts
    export default {
      // ...
      parameters: {
        controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true, disabled: true },
        actions: { disabled: true },
        backgrounds: { disable: true },
      },
    };
    ```

- **Atoms, Molecules & Organisms:**
  - Stories for **atoms**, **molecules**, and **organisms** must always display the Storybook addon panel.
  - Ensure that all relevant props are exposed as controls, and that actions/interactions are visible when applicable.
  - This allows for interactive testing, prop manipulation, and documentation of component APIs.

---

## Rationale

- **Pages/Templates** are meant to show real-world usage and layout, not to be interactively manipulated.
- **Atoms/Molecules/Organisms** are building blocks and benefit from interactive controls for development and documentation.

---

## Enforcement

- Review all new and existing stories to ensure compliance with this convention.
- Add Storybook parameters as needed to enable/disable the addon panel according to the component type.
- Document this rule in onboarding and code review processes.

## Example

```ts
// Page/Template Story (no addon panel)
export default {
  title: 'Pages/MyPage',
  component: MyPage,
  parameters: {
    controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true, disabled: true },
    actions: { disabled: true },
    backgrounds: { disable: true },
  },
};

// Atom/Molecule/Organism Story (with addon panel)
export default {
  title: 'Atoms/Button',
  component: Button,
  // No need to disable controls/actions
};
```
